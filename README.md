📄 Overview
This project demonstrates an ETL Pipeline for sentiment analysis, handling data extraction, transformation, and loading into a database. The pipeline is designed to preprocess data for a machine learning model that predicts sentiment from text.

⚙️ Features
Data Extraction: Fetch data from an online CSV file (Kaggle dataset).
Data Transformation: Clean and preprocess text data, handling missing values and encoding labels.
Data Loading: Save processed data into a SQLite database.
Model Training: Train a sentiment analysis model using a Logistic Regression classifier.
Local Deployment: Run the pipeline locally for processing and prediction.
